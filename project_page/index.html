                    A sculpture in itself, <i><b>Yon</b></i> is a multi-funtional object intended to be used as a furniture piece. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The unique form was designed with the concept of lightness and continuity. Through the visual process of tracing the curves, a unique view is offered from every angle. Yon employs the raw qualities of steel to create sculptural forms that are both beautiful and useful in the home.

                <p>
                    #1<br>
                    According to Orit Gat, artists have more freedom in choosing the ways they want their art to be exhibited on their own website. While on social medias like facebook or instagram, they gain more interaction with their viewers although the artists lose flexibility on how their works are presented. What can we do to combine the benefit of the two platforms?

                    What will happen if a website becomes an artwork itself instead of just being a platform?
