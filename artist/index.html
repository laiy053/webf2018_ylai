            <h1>DAGNY</h1>

            <h2>Norwegian Fearless Soul</h2>

            <p>Born Dagny Norvoll Sandvik, Dagny is a Norwegian pop singer and songwriter who hails from the northern city of Tromsø. The daughter of jazz guitarist/composer Øystein Norvoll and jazz singer Marit Sandvik, she relocated to London, England in her twenties before her debut single, "Backbeat," appeared in September 2015. It quickly became a streaming hit, garnering half-a-million plays in its first week and millions more in the months that followed. Her debut EP, Ultraviolet, arrived in 2016. The five-track collection included the title track and "Fool's Gold" with BØRNS. The "Wearing Nothing" single was issued the following year. <br>
