                    In Barbara Wright’s text, suggests that one of the characteristic that makes Queneau successful is that he combines humor and serious in his poet. She says “Queneau … is not limited, and he doesn't take himself over-seriously. He's too wise. He doesn't limit himself to being either serious or frivolous-or even, I might say, to being either a scientist or an artist. He's both.” When it comes to website with serious information (e.g. academic journal, news), should we make the websites more humorous just to make them more appealing to the readers?

                    Do you think humor/easiness is necessarily in creating a successful user experience?
