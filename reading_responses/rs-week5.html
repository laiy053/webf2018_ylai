					In Michael Rock’s Fuck Content, he states that “What is a How. Our content is, perpetually, Design itself.” He believes that what contributes to the success of a story/design is not what the story/design is, it is how the story/design is presented. Based on his theory, if we tell a story in a style that is completely  irrelevant or even the opposite to the content itself (e.g. make a horror movie in the style of a romance film), do you think the story or storytelling will still be successful?
