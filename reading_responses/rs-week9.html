        <h3>Reading 9: <i>Design As Art</i> REFLECTION</h3>
        <p>

                   
			The boundry between art and design is a very fuzzy one, at least to me. I believe that design is a combination of art and science. Take the color palette of the detergent package designed mention in the article as an example, the color palette is a form of art while a certain color evokes a certain feeling which falls under the category of science. Design constantly evolves just like art does based on the development of medium. In conclusion, my thoughts are, design contains art. Art is a form of design.
