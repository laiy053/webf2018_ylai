					I personally found the inconsistent typefaces in Sinisterâ€™s text very distracting. To me ,the content has become more difficult to read because of that. Can we conclude that in order to increase efficiency, we should try to minimize the amount of typefaces being used when we design layout?<br>

					Since everyone has their own tastes of font choice, should web designer/interaction designer let the users personalize the font styles on their interface? Would that affect the pre-designed user experience that the designers are intended on?
